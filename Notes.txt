Time to get refocused. Have had zero motivation to do anything outside of work and family. 
Started a new job with a pay raise that out weighs the pros of switching to data science 
- so, decided against UC Berkeley.
I think its time to focus on building a passive income with a blog and youtube channel. 
I just need to stay focused and motivated. 


Goals 
1. Finish building blog and portfolio 
2. Start a Youtube channel 
3. Decide on content 
4. Research equipment
